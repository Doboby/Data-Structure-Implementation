# GROUP- DOBBY - lab 1 - variant 5

Set based on hash-map (collision resolution: open address)
We use Linear detection of open address to collision resolution

## Project structure

- `HashMapMutable.py` -- implementation of `Node` class for basic Data Structure.
   and `HashMap` class with `__len__` `add` `get` and `remove` features.
- `HashMapMutable_test.py` -- we set tests for `HashMapMutable`.

## Contribution

## Design notes

- In this lab work, We have completed some basic operations on the dictionary structure.
- These operations about: `__len__` `add` `get` `get_hash_value` and `remove`.
- Our code has been committed into the github <https://github.com/Doboby/Data-Structure-Implementation>
